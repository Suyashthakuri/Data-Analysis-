## üì± 1. Mobile Price Classification

**Goal:**  
Build a classification model to predict the price range (low, medium, high, very high) of mobile phones based on hardware specifications.

**Dataset:** Mobile device specifications with features like RAM, battery, camera quality, and connectivity.

**Key Steps:**
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and handled binary/categorical features
- Studied feature correlations and selected the most impactful variables
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN)
- Assessed accuracy and confusion matrices to compare performance

**Outcome:**  
Identified features like RAM and battery power as strong predictors of mobile pricing tiers.

## üè† 2. Housing Price Prediction

**Goal:**  
Use regression models to predict housing prices based on location, demographics, and property attributes.

**Dataset:** U.S. housing data with features such as median age, number of rooms, population, and income.

**Key Steps:**
- Cleaned and explored the dataset (handled missing values, scaled features)
- Built and evaluated models including Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and GridSearchCV for optimization
- Evaluated using R¬≤, RMSE, and MAE

**Outcome:**  
Developed a robust predictive model with interpretable feature importance for real estate pricing.

## üõí 3. E-Commerce User Rating Prediction

**Goal:**  
Predict user ratings for e-commerce items using linear regression.

**Dataset:** Cleaned transactional dataset including user IDs, item prices, timestamps, and helpfulness scores.

**Key Steps:**
- Imported and explored user-item interaction data
- Applied linear regression to model rating predictions
- Assessed how different feature combinations and training/test splits affect performance
- Evaluated models with MAE, MSE, and R¬≤

**Outcome:**  
Demonstrated how rating prediction can improve personalized recommendations in e-commerce platforms.
